    abstract = "Contextual word embedding models such as ELMo and BERT have dramatically improved performance for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent months. However, these models have been minimally explored on specialty corpora, such as clinical text; moreover, in the clinical domain, no publicly-available pre-trained BERT models yet exist. In this work, we address this need by exploring and releasing BERT models for clinical text: one for generic clinical text and another for discharge summaries specifically. We demonstrate that using a domain-specific model yields performance improvements on 3/5 clinical NLP tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MedNLI dataset. We find that these domain-specific models are not as performant on 2 clinical de-identification tasks, and argue that this is a natural consequence of the differences between de-identified source text and synthetically non de-identified task text.",

abstract = {Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is commonly used to assess cardiac structure and function. One disadvantage of CMR is that post-processing of exams is tedious. Without automation, precise assessment of cardiac function via CMR typically requires an annotator to spend tens of minutes per case manually contouring ventricular structures. Automatic contouring can lower the required time per patient by generating contour suggestions that can be lightly modified by the annotator. Fully convolutional networks (FCNs), a variant of convolutional neural networks, have been used to rapidly advance the state-of-the-art in automated segmentation, which makes FCNs a natural choice for ventricular segmentation. However, FCNs are limited by their computational cost, which increases the monetary cost and degrades the user experience of production systems. To combat this shortcoming, we have developed the FastVentricle architecture, an FCN architecture for ventricular segmentation based on the recently developed ENet architecture. FastVentricle is 4x faster and runs with 6x less memory than the previous state-of-the-art ventricular segmentation architecture while still maintaining excellent clinical accuracy.},

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is known to cause adverse remodeling of left atrium (LA). Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of AF is associated with decrease in LA volume. However, the impact of RFCA on left atrial appendage (LAA) volume and hemodynamic function is not fully understood. We analyzed 123 patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation before and after RFCA in Korea University Anam Hospital. LA and LAA volume were measured before and after RFCA based on cardiac MRI. Baseline LA volume was 99.5 ± 38.4 cm3 and decreased to 74.6 ± 28.5 cm3 after RFCA (p {\textless} 0.001). LA diameter measured with transthoracic echocardiography was also decreased after RFCA (43.3 ± 6.2 mm at baseline and 39.9 ± 5.9 mm at follow up; p {\textless} 0.001). However, LAA volume was significantly increased after RFCA (19.4 ± 8.5 cm3 at baseline and 23.7 ± 13.3 cm3 at follow up; p {\textless} 0.001). Total ablation time and additional substrate modification was associated with change in LA volume. After RFCA, average LAA velocity measured by transesophageal echocardiography was increased to 51.0 cm/sec from 41.1 cm/sec (p {\textless} 0.001). In conclusion, LAA volume was increased after RFCA in contrast to LA volume. Our data raise a concern about worsening hemodynamics of LA and LAA following RFCA and long term clinical significance of enlarged LAA after RFCA needs further evaluation.},

@article{DeVos2017,
abstract = {Localization of anatomical structures is a prerequisite for many tasks in medical image analysis. We propose a method for automatic localization of one or more anatomical structures in 3D medical images through detection of their presence in 2D image slices using a convolutional neural network (ConvNet). A single ConvNet is trained to detect presence of the anatomical structure of interest in axial, coronal, and sagittal slices extracted from a 3D image. To allow the ConvNet to analyze slices of different sizes, spatial pyramid pooling is applied. After detection, 3D bounding boxes are created by combining the output of the ConvNet in all slices. In the experiments 200 chest CT, 100 cardiac CT angiography (CTA), and 100 abdomen CT scans were used. The heart, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta were localized in chest CT scans, the left cardiac ventricle in cardiac CTA scans, and the liver in abdomen CT scans. Localization was evaluated using the distances between automatically and manually defined reference bounding box centroids and walls. The best results were achieved in localization of structures with clearly defined boundaries (e.g. aortic arch) and the worst when the structure boundary was not clearly visible (e.g. liver). The method was more robust and accurate in localization multiple structures.},
annote = {Supervised CNN
It is based on their previous work[13](2D to 3D), they use one 2D convNets to detect orthogonal viewing planes and then combing convnet outputs for all axial, coronal and sagittal slices.

cc comments: this localization network is only suitble for multiple organ object localization. due to its post-processing and also the network limit. for multi-instancedetection, it doean't work. Also, it suffers from the variation among cases. need to improve further.

hightlights:
1. use of spatial pyramid pooling to support multi-resolution images
2. It is worthy of looking into inner image acquisition and reconstruction parameters for better normalization.
3. support muli-object localization benefit from the two node design.
4. techniques to combine results from 3 viewing planes in 2D space to 3D space.
5. discussion part is good.

point out that RNN might be a promising approach to modeling spatial relationship in these kind of sequenc-like data.

    abstract = { Although 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is well established in neuroradiology and musculoskeletal imaging, it is in the nascent stages in cardiovascular imaging applications, and there is limited literature on this topic. The primary advantage of 3 T over 1.5 T is a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which can be used as such or traded off to improve spatial or temporal resolution and decrease acquisition time. However, the actual gain in SNR is limited by other factors and modifications in sequences adapted for use at 3 T. Higher resonance frequencies result in improved spectral resolution, which is beneficial for fat suppression and spectroscopy. The higher T1 values of tissues at 3 T aid in myocardial tagging, angiography, and perfusion and delayed-enhancement sequences. However, there are substantial challenges with 3-T cardiac MR imaging, including higher magnetic field and radiofrequency inhomogeneities and susceptibility effects, which diminish image quality. Off-resonance artifacts are particularly challenging, especially with steady-state free precession sequences. These artifacts can be managed by using higher-order shimming, frequency scouts, or low repetition times. B1 inhomogeneities can be managed by using radiofrequency shimming, multitransmit coils, or adiabatic pulses. Chemical shifts are also increased at 3 T. The higher radiofrequency results in higher radiofrequency deposition power and a higher specific absorption rate. MR angiography, dynamic first-pass perfusion sequences, myocardial tagging, and MR spectroscopy are more effective at 3 T, whereas delayed-enhancement, flow quantification, and black-blood sequences are comparable at 1.5 T and 3 T. Knowledge of the relevant physics helps in identifying artifacts and modifying sequences to optimize image quality. Online supplemental material is available for this article.©RSNA, 2014 }

abstract="Deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural nets have consistently outperformed previous methods on challenging tasks such as dense, semantic segmentation. However, the various proposed networks perform differently, with behaviour largely influenced by architectural choices and training settings. This paper explores Ensembles of Multiple Models and Architectures (EMMA) for robust performance through aggregation of predictions from a wide range of methods. The approach reduces the influence of the meta-parameters of individual models and the risk of overfitting the configuration to a particular database. EMMA can be seen as an unbiased, generic deep learning model which is shown to yield excellent performance, winning the first position in the BRATS 2017 competition among 50+ participating teams.",

abstract="Accurate segmentation of the heart is an important step towards evaluating cardiac function. In this paper, we present a fully automated framework for segmentation of the left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular cavities and the myocardium (Myo) on short-axis cardiac MR images. We investigate various 2D and 3D convolutional neural network architectures for this task. Experiments were performed on the ACDC 2017 challenge training dataset comprising cardiac MR images of 100 patients, where manual reference segmentations were made available for end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) frames. We find that processing the images in a slice-by-slice fashion using 2D networks is beneficial due to a relatively large slice thickness. However, the exact network architecture only plays a minor role. We report mean Dice coefficients of 0.950 (LV), 0.893 (RV), and 0.899 (Myo), respectively with an average evaluation time of 1.1 s per volume on a modern GPU.",

Domain adaptation algorithms have been proposed to compensate for the degradation in performance due to domain shift. In this paper, we address the case when the target domain is unlabeled, requiring unsupervised adaptation. CORAL is a "frustratingly easy" unsupervised domain adaptation method that aligns the second-order statistics of the source and target distributions with a linear transformation. Here, we extend CORAL to learn a nonlinear transformation that aligns correlations of layer activations in deep neural networks (Deep CORAL). Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art performance.},
